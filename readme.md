The visual representation of the audio files from the **Dyad** sound releases can be viewed and modified in the Dyad application. There are a few self explanatory sliders for adjusting the parameters of the visual output along these quick interface hints:

`▶️ Play / Pause (Space bar)`

`📂 Open audio file / open folder in playlist`

`🎙 Use microphone or other input source`

`↕️↔️🔄 Flip vertically / horizontally or rotate`

`🅰️ Use digital or analog visual output`

`⚙ Change output device`

`↗️ Fullscreen (f key)`

The Dyad application is made possible by the extensive research of [Hansi Raber](https://kasuga-records.com/artists/hansi-raber/) for his "[OsciStudio](https://oscilloscopemusic.com/oscistudio.php)" and "[Oscilloscope](https://asdfg.me/osci/)" project.
